One of the reasons for creating ClojureScript is that JavaScript
reaches. There are many interesting environments in which JavaScript can
run. Each of these environments has something unique about it. One of
the reasons that Clojure rocks is that it has a REPL which gives
developers the most dynamic development experience possible. We would
like to support this dynamic development experience in every environment
where JavaScript runs. To accomplish this, we have created an
abstraction around the JavaScript environment and disconnected the REPL
from any particular implementation. This gives the REPL the same reach
as JavaScript as well as allowing evaluation environment implementations
to be used independently for things like automated testing and
cross-environment testing.

Most projects will target a specific environment. These changes will
allow developers to have the full benefit of a REPL in their target
environment. Currently there are implementations for multiple
environments. By implementing one protocol, one may easily support additional
environments.

[[using-the-repl]]
== Using the REPL

The basic usage of the REPL is always the same:

1. require `cljs.repl`
2. require the namespace which implements the desired evaluation
environment
3. create a new evaluation environment
4. start the REPL with the created environment

Using the REPL will also feel the same in each environment; forms are
entered, results are printed and side-effects happen where they make the
most sense.

[[using-the-browser-as-an-evaluation-environment]]
=== Using the browser as an Evaluation Environment

A browser-connected REPL works in much the same way as a normal REPL:
forms are read from the console, evaluated and return values are
printed. A major and useful difference from normal REPL usage is that
all side-effects occur in the browser. You can show alerts, manipulate
the dom and interact with a running application.

There is a sample project under `samples/repl` which shows how to set up
a minimal browser-connected REPL. The example below will walk through
doing the same thing, step-by-step.

The first step is to create the browser side of the connection. This is
done by requiring one file and adding one line of code, as shown below
in a file named `foo.cljs`.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns foo
  (:require [clojure.browser.repl :as repl]))
(repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl")
----

The most interesting use case for a browser-connected REPL is to connect
it to a project and use the REPL to drive and develop an application
while it is running. To accomplish this, add the code above to any
namespace in the project.

Next, compile the file in either development mode or with simple
optimizations. No advanced optimizations please.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/cljsc foo.cljs > foo.js
----

Create a host html page named index.html like the one shown below.

....
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Browser-connected REPL</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="content">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="out/goog/base.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="foo.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        goog.require('foo');
      </script>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
....

There is nothing different about this and what one would do for any
other browser-based ClojureScript project.

Start the REPL using the pattern described above, but with the browser
as the evaluation environment.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[cljs.repl :as repl])
(require '[cljs.repl.browser :as browser])  ;; require the browser implementation of IJavaScriptEnv
(def env (browser/repl-env)) ;; create a new environment
(repl/repl env) ;; start the REPL
----

Once the REPL has started, you will see the message "Starting server on
port 9000". At this point, open the html page by going to
http://localhost:9000 to complete the connection. Once the page is open
and the connection is made, the REPL prompt will be displayed.

Port 9000 is the default. Notice that we point the browser to this port
in the client code above. To use a different port, pass a :port option
when creating a new evaluation environment.

[source,clojure]
----
(def env (browser/repl-env :port 8090)) ;; listen on port 8090
----

Just in case you can't think of anything interesting to do, here are
some ideas.

[source,clojure]
----
;; the basics
(+ 1 1)
(:a {:a :b})
(reduce + [1 2 3 4 5])
(defn sum [coll] (reduce + coll))
(sum [2 2 2 2])

;; load a ClojureScript file and use it
(load-file "clojure/string.cljs")
(clojure.string/reverse "ClojureScript")

;; browser specific
(js/alert "I am an evil side-effect")

(ns test.dom (:require [clojure.browser.dom :as dom]))
(dom/append (dom/get-element "content")
            (dom/element "ClojureScript is all up in your DOM."))

;; load and use goog code we haven't used yet
(ns test.crypt (:require [goog.crypt :as c]))
(c/stringToByteArray "ClojureScript")

(load-namespace 'goog.date.Date)
(goog.date.Date.)
----

There is currently no `require` function but `ns` forms can be used to
load, require and alias new namespaces. The functions `load-file` and
`load-namespace` can be used to load code with any environment and are
described in more detail below.

[[browser-connected-repl-options]]
==== Browser-connected REPL Options

There are currently two options which may be used to configure the
browser evaluation environment.

* `:port` set the port to listen on - defaults to 9000
* `:working-dir` set the working directory for compiling REPL related
code - defaults to ".repl"

[[loading-code]]
=== Loading code

The code above shows examples of three ways to load code into an
evaluation environment: `load-file`, `load-namespace` and within a `ns`
form. `load-file` is the most low level method of loading code. It may
only be used to load ClojureScript files. It will compile them and
evaluate the compiled JavaScript. `load-namespace` loads any file,
ClojureScript or JavaScript, with all of its dependencies, which have
not already been loaded, in dependency order. When a namespace is
required in an `ns` form, each required namespace will be loaded using
`load-namespace`.

These functions are available in every evaluation environment.

[[auto-loaded-user-code]]
=== Auto-loaded user code

When a REPL starts, it automatically loads any `user.cljs` or `user.cljc`
file present on your classpath. This is an ideal location to place code
that is useful for development time.

The file may optionally contain an `ns` form in order to load required
namespaces or to establish the namespace for any `def` forms that appear
in the file.

If no namespace is specified, `cljs.user` is assumed.

[[implementation]]
== Implementation

If you would like to work on this code then the following notes about
implementation will be helpful.

[[goals]]
=== Goals

* No additional dependencies
* Should work *now* in all browsers
* Security is a non-goal, this is for development and testing

[[the-ijavascriptenv-protocol]]
=== The IJavaScriptEnv Protocol

To create a new environment, implement the IJavaScriptEnv protocol.

[source,clojure]
----
(defprotocol IJavaScriptEnv
  (-setup [this opts])
  (-evaluate [this filename line js])
  (-load [this ns url])
  (-tear-down [this]))
----

`setup` and `tear-down` do any work which is required to create and
destroy the JavaScript evaluation environment. These functions will have
side-effects and will return nil.

`evaluate` takes a file name, line number and a JavaScript string and
evaluates the string returning a map with the keys `:status` and
`:value`. The value of status may be `:success`, `:error` or
`:exception`. `:value` will be the return value or an error message. In
the case of an exception, there may be a `:stacktrace` key containing
the stack trace.

The `load` function takes a list of namespaces which are provided by a
JavaScript file and the URL for the file and will load JavaScript from
the given URL into the environment. The implementation is not
responsible for ensuring that each namespace is loaded once and only
once, as this is <<xref/../../../guides/custom-repls#eliminating-loaded-libs-tracking,managed
by the infrastructure>>.

[[browser-as-evaluation-environment]]
=== Browser as Evaluation Environment

To create the browser-connected REPL and meet the goals described above,
we use long-polling and Google's CrossPageChannel. Long-polling allows
us to treat the browser as the server and CrossPageChannel helps us get
around the same-origin policy.

The model for a browser-connected REPL is that the REPL is the client
and the browser is the server which evaluates JavaScript code. How do we
implement this without resorting to WebSockets? If we think of the
connection as a series of messages being passed between the browser and
the REPL, and we ignore the first message sent from the browser, then we
have what we need. When the browser initially connects, the REPL will
hold that connection until is has something to send for evaluation. Once
the next form is read and compiled, it will be sent to the browser using
that saved connection. The browser will evaluate it and send the result
with a new connection. And the cycle repeats...

Browsers enforce a same-origin policy for JavaScript code. This means
that the JavaScript which is evaluated in a page can come from only one
origin domain. This is a problem for the browser-connected REPL because
FireFox and Chrome both view opening a file from the file system and
connecting to localhost:9000 as different domains. It may also be a
valid use case to want to connect to an application served from a
totally different domain, which would be prohibited in all browsers.

Fortunately, Google has also run into this problem and has created
something called a CrossPageChannel. Without going into the details,
this allows an iframe served from one domain (the REPL) to communicate
with the parent page which was served from another domain (the
application server). This is accomplished in a way that is supported by
all modern browsers.

[[code-loading-in-the-browser]]
=== Code loading in the Browser

Google Closure has a technique for loading dependencies. It uses a
dependency file to create a dependency graph and to map namespaces to
files. The ClojureScript `build` function creates this kind of
dependency file when compiling a project in development mode. Google
Closure makes the assumption that everything that needs to known about
dependencies will be known when the application starts. This assumption
is not valid when using a REPL and leads to two limitations.

The first limitation is that all dependencies need to be included in
these files before the application starts. We cannot add new
dependencies later for new ClojureScript or JavaScript namespaces that
we would like to use.

Another limitation is that Google's method of loading dependencies
assumes that all dependencies will be loaded when the application
starts. The implementation of `goog.writeScriptTag_` uses
`document.write` to add new script tags to a page. This works when it is
used during the initial page load but if used after the page is loaded,
it will remove the document's content. This means that even if the
dependency file contains the dependency that we would like to load, it
cannot be loaded. This can be fixed. See
https://github.com/ibdknox/brepl/blob/master/out/brepl.js for an
example.

The ClojureScript REPL already has a `load-file` function which can be
used to load a single ClojureScript file. This function does not account
for dependencies and cannot be used to load third-party JavaScript
files.

This suggests that we need one unified way to load things which will
work for anything that we may want to load. The `load-namespace`
function was created for this purpose. It uses the build system to
calculate all dependencies for the given namespace. This includes
anything that we can currently build into a project: ClojureScript
files, JavaScript files as well as third-party ClojureScript and
JavaScript. Each dependency is then passed to the `-load` function in
dependency order. The `-load` function is responsible to determining if
the namespace has already been loaded and, if it has not, evaluating the
JavaScript.

When the REPL compiles a namespace form, it will check for required
namespaces and call `load-namespace` on each of them.

Note: conveying the :libs option to the REPL so that it can find
third-party JavaScript libraries has not yet been implemented.
