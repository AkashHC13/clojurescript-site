This page documents advice for people wanting to build ClojureScript
projects that want or need to leverage `cljs.js/eval-str` and other
self-hosted functionality.

[WARNING]
====
If you are building a web application where the final size
of the deployed artifact matters significantly, you should not be using
any of the functionality outlined on this page.

=== Production Builds

You can leverage up to `:optimization :simple` with builds that include
the `cljs.js` namespace. Other recommended settings:

[source,clojure]
----
:pretty-print false
:optimize-constants true
:static-fns true
----

`:optimize-constants` is significant for code size, all literal keywords
and symbols in your source will be compiled into a single lookup table.

`:static-fns true` is especially important if you are targeting Safari /
JavaScriptCore. (See
https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJS-1381[CLJS-1381] for details.)

By default for ease of use `cljs.js/empty-state` will dump the analysis
cache for `cljs.core` directly into the `cljs.js` namespace. This
doubles the size of the final artifact. You can disable this with
setting `:dump-core false` in your compiler build options.

This means you will need to load the analysis for core yourself. It's
easy to dump the core analysis cache. In your ClojureScript project load
a _Clojure_ REPL and do something like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io]
         '[cognitect.transit :as transit])
(import [java.io ByteArrayOutputStream])

(def out-path
  "../../assets/js/cljs/core.cljs.cache.aot.json")
(def out (ByteArrayOutputStream. 1000000))
(def writer (transit/writer out :json))

(def cache
  (read-string
    (slurp (io/resource "cljs/core.cljs.cache.aot.edn"))))

(transit/write writer cache)

(spit (io/file out-path) (.toString out))
----

Then in your _ClojureScript_ source you can load this cache - for
example that might look something like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(def st (cljs.js/empty-state))

;; path to Transit encoded analysis cache
(def cache-url "/assets/js/cljs/core.cljs.cache.aot.json")

(defn main []
  (http/get cache-url
    (fn [json]
      (let [rdr   (transit/reader :json)
            cache (transit/read rdr json)]
        (cljs.js/load-analysis-cache! st 'cljs.core cache)
        ;; ...
        ))))
----

This simple optimization eliminates about 2.7mb of generated JavaScript.
