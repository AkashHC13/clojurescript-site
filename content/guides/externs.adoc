This page documents how to write externs for third party JavaScript libraries
that do not conform to Google Closure Compiler conventions
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/limitations. The features
described should be considered of alpha quality and subject to change.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Many useful libraries cannot go through Google Closure Compiler advanced
compilation. Thus they cannot be a part of the build and are considered
"foreign". Still Closure must know something about these libraries, otherwise
properties may be unintentionally renamed. Unfortunately, often this accidental
renaming won't be apparent until the least opportune time - production.

For libraries that already have mature externs this type of mistake is easily
avoided. However, this requirement adds an incredible amount of friction to the
adoption of newer or less popular but equally useful libraries. With the arrival
of externs inference, the ClojureScript compiler can now automatically generate
missing externs as well as greatly aid the process of writing comprehensive
externs.

[[externs-inference]]
== Externs Inference

Imagine that we have specified a foreign library `some.fooLib`. We would like
to write interop against this library but have certainty that the correct
externs will be automatically generated.

First we must supply the `:infer-externs true` in our compiler configuration:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[cljs.build.api :as b])

(b/build "src"
  {:main 'my-project.core
   :output-to "out/main.js"
   :output-dir "out"
   :optimizations :none
   :infer-externs true})
----

There is a new file local dynamic var `*warn-on-infer*`. Once set the compiler
will warn for the remainder of the file anytime it cannot determine the types
involved in a dot form, whether property access or method invocation.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.core
  (:require [some.fooLib]))

(set! *warn-on-infer* true)

(defn wrap-baz [x]
  (.baz x))
----

The above code would trigger a warning message:

----
Cannot infer target type in expression (.bar x) ...
----

We simply need to type-hint x with the foreign type for this interop call:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.core
  (:require [some.fooLib]))

(set! *warn-on-infer* true)

(defn wrap-baz [^js/Foo.Bar x]
  (.baz x))
----

The compiler now has enough information to automatically generate the required
externs. When you run your build you will see a new file in your output
directory `inferred_externs.js`. If you examine its content it will probably
look similar to the following:

[source,javascript]
----
var Foo = {};
Foo.Bar = function() {};
Foo.Bar.prototype.baz = function() {};
----

[[writing-externs]]
== Hand Written Externs

Local type hints go a long way to automating the process of writing externs.
However for interop heavy code this will lead to a lot of type hinting
particularly for the return values of commonly used functions. In this case it's
probably better to provide the externs file. However, even in this case the
ClojureScript compiler can ease the process:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.core
  (:require [some.fooLib]))

(set! *warn-on-infer* true)

(defn some-fn [^js/Foo.Bar x]
  (let [z (.baz x)]
    (.-wozz z)))
----

Imagine that our externs file looks something like the following:

[source,javascript]
----
var Foo = {};
/**
 * @constructor
 */
Foo.Bar = function() {};
Foo.Bar.prototype.baz = function() {};
/**
 * @constructor
 */
var Foo.Boo = function() {};
Foo.Boo.prototype.woz = function() {};
----

However this isn't sufficient for knowing the type of `z` in the ClojureScript
program.

We simply need to add the return type information to the externs file:

[source,javascript]
----
var Foo = {};
/**
 * @constructor
 */
Foo.Bar = function() {};
/**
 * @return [Foo.Boo]
 */
Foo.Bar.prototype.baz = function() {};
/**
 * @constructor
 */
var Foo.Boo = function() {};
Foo.Boo.prototype.woz = function() {};
----
