The following instructions are for ClojureScript >= 0.0-3165.

Assuming you already have `clojure-mode`, run `M-x package-list-packages` and install `inf-clojure`. If you are using Emacs on OS X be sure to install `exec-path-from-shell` so that the Node.js REPL will work correctly. If you need `exec-path-from-shell` make sure to follow the https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell#usage[Usage] instructions.

Create a REPL file that starts whatever REPL you like (refer to the <<xref/../../../guides/quick-start#,Quick Start>>) and put it in your current directory. For example a `repl.clj` file for the Node.js REPL would look like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.repl)
(require 'cljs.repl.node)
(cljs.repl/repl (cljs.repl.node/repl-env))
----

Edit your `.emacs` or `init.el` and add a function like the following if you are using the JAR in your current directory:

[source,clojure]
----
(defun cljs-node-repl ()
  (interactive)
  (inf-clojure "java -cp cljs.jar clojure.main repl.clj"))
----

If you are using Leiningen:

[source,clojure]
----
(defun cljs-node-repl ()
  (interactive)
  (inf-clojure "lein trampoline run -m clojure.main repl.clj"))
----

Open your ClojureScript file and run `M-x cljs-node-repl`. You'll get a new buffer with the REPL. Switch back to your file and run `M-x inf-clojure-minor-mode`. `C-c C-l` will load the file. `C-c Meta-n` will switch your namespace. If you place your cursor at the end of a s-expression, `C-x C-e` will evaluate that expression. `C-c C-v` will show the docs. `C-c C-s` will show the source. `C-c <return>` will macroexpand. Refer to https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure[inf-clojure] for more documentation.
