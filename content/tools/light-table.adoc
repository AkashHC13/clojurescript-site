http://www.lighttable.com[Light Table] is an extensible IDE that offers
instant evaluation of your code, realtime feedback, and a ClojureScript
plugin ecosystem.

To get started, check out this concise
http://docs.lighttable.com/#start[introduction] or the
http://docs.lighttable.com/tutorials/full/[full tutorial].

Once you feel comfortable navigating Light Table's interface and using
basic commands, it is advisable to install the official Paredit plugin.
You can do so via the integrated plugin manager: open the command bar
and look for `Plugins: Show plugin manager`.
