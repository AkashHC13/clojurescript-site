= Running REPLs

As of 0.0-2665 REPLs have changed significantly enough that many
existing third party REPLs and REPL launchers no longer work. While they
are likely to be updated in the near future the following demonstrates
how to run REPLs directly without using anything more than Leiningen
itself.

All that is required is to make a REPL runner *.clj* file. For example
if your cljsbuild entry looks like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
{:id "dev"
 :source-paths ["src"]
 :compiler {
   :output-to "hello_world.js"
   :output-dir "out"
   :optimizations :none
   :cache-analysis true
   :source-map true}}
----

Then your *repl.clj* file should look like the following for Node.js:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
  '[cljs.repl :as repl]
  '[cljs.repl.node :as node])

(repl/repl* (node/repl-env)
  {:output-dir "out"
   :optimizations :none
   :cache-analysis true
   :source-map true})
----

You can then run the REPL against your build with the following:

....
lein trampoline run -m clojure.main repl.clj
....

For better behavior at the command line, install
http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/[rlwrap] (under OS X easily
done with http://brew.sh[brew]), then:

....
rlwrap lein trampoline run -m clojure.main repl.clj
....

Browser REPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browser REPL is almost exactly the same setting up a Node.js REPL.

Your `browser_repl.clj` should look like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
  '[cljs.repl :as repl]
  '[cljs.repl.browser :as browser])

(repl/repl* (browser/repl-env)
  {:output-dir "out"
   :optimizations :none
   :cache-analysis true
   :source-map true})
----

Remember that you must change your source file to include the browser
REPL:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [clojure.browser.repl :as repl]))

(repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl")

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello world!")
----

Then build your project:

....
lein cljsbuild once hello-world
....

Now you can launch your browser REPL:

....
lein trampoline run -m clojure.main browser_repl.clj
....
