To report an issue please file a question on https://ask.clojure.org[ask.clojure.org] under the ClojureScript category and tag it with `problem`. CLJS developers can assess and determine whether it is an issue. If needed, they can file a ticket in the https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJS[ClojureScript issue tracker].

It's important that before submitting any issue that you have a thorough
understanding of the <<xref/../../../guides/quick-start#,Quick Start>> first. Even if you are an
experienced ClojureScript developer this is required reading.

It's helpful, but not essential, to first check the
https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJS[existing bug reports], the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurescript[mailing list], or
the Freenode #clojurescript IRC channel or Slack channels and ensure
that the issue hasn't been reported before.

Also, it can be helpful to ensure that you are running the latest
released version of ClojureScript. Also, checking against ClojureScript
master is prudentâ€”frequently when bugs are found, fixes are quickly
committed (see instructions below).

It is essential, however, to report the bug using ClojureScript only.
Downstream tooling often interacts with the ClojureScript compiler in
non-trivial ways, and the best way to isolate the issue to ClojureScript
is to remove them from the report altogether.

Please report issues by building the uberjar from master and using this
to verify the issue. Using https://clojurescript.org/reference/repl-and-main[`cljs.main`]
with this uberjar to create a minimal repro is ideal. Alternatively,
using https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[`clj`] and `deps.edn` is
acceptable. Do not use any other 3rd party tooling (Maven,
Leiningen, Boot). When creating issues please add all relevant
instructions and code to reproduce to the ticket directly or via
additional comments. Please do not attach projects, links to projects,
links to gists / pastebins, or zips.

[NOTE]
====
Bootstrap issues may require special consideration. Please see <<reporting-bootstrap-issues#,Reporting Bootstrap Issues>> for more details.

[[building-the-uberjar-from-master]]
=== Building the uberjar from master

Make a checkout of the ClojureScript repository. From the root of the
project run the following:

[source,bash]
----
./script/uberjar    
----

This will create `target/cljs.jar`.

[[installing-from-master]]
=== Installing from master

When verifying issues it may be useful to first check that the issue has
not already been resolved in master. __Do not report issues using this
method, it's only for convenience when verifying master yourself__. Make
a checkout of the ClojureScript repository. From the root of the project
run the following:

[source,bash]
----
./script/build        
----

This will install ClojureScript into your local Maven. Make note of the
version when it scrolls by. Use this as appropriate for your tooling.

[[pinpointing-regressions-with-git-bisect]]
=== Pinpointing Regressions with git bisect

If you've discovered a regression, it is helpful to identify and information
regarding the first bad commit when reporting issues. This is easy to do by
first depending on a checkout of ClojureScript as a local root dependency and
then using git bisect.

For this example, let's say you've discovered a regression that is reproducible
directly in the REPL (variations on the below can be employed if not).

First checkout ClojureScript master and `cd` to the top of the checkout tree.

Assuming you can reproduce the issue on master, but that things worked with
ClojureScript 1.10.748, issue these commands at the top of the checkout tree:

[source,bash]
----
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good r1.10.748
----

Then start up a REPL against the current state of the checkout tree by issuing

[source,bash]
----
clj -Srepro -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:local/root "/<path-to-checkout>/clojurescript"}}}' -m cljs.main -r
----

Test to see if you can reproduce the issue in the REPL and then exit the REPL.

If you couldn't reproduce the issue:

[source,bash]
----
git bisect good
----

Or, if you were able to reproduce the issue:

[source,bash]
----
git bisect bad
----

If the bisect is complete, git will indicate that a certain commit hash 
"is the first bad commit". Copy all of this text for JIRA.

Otherwise restart the REPL and repeat the above steps until done.

When finished, you can do this to restore your git checkout:

[source,bash]
----
git bisect reset
----
