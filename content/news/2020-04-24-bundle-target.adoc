ClojureScript 1.10.739 includes a new streamlined way to integrate with the
existing JavaScript ecosystem - the bundle target. With this target, the output
of the ClojureScript compiler can be immediately handed off to a JavaScript
bundler like Webpack, Metro, or any other build tool that understands Node.js
`require`. ClojureScript projects using this new target can freely integrate
libraries from `node_modules` without handwritten externs or additional
configuraiton, yet still fully leverage REPL-driven development and advanced
compilation for the optimizable parts of their application.

While the impact on ease of development for ClojureScript projects is
obviously significant, we believe that the benefits for the ClojureScript
ecosystem are even more exciting. You can now publish ClojureScript libraries
that depend directly on the JavaScript ecosystem without additional ceremony
and be confident that the whole community can benefit regardless of what
other JavaScript and ClojureScript build tools they may prefer.

If you want to cut to the chase and walk through a tutorial, head over to the
<<xref/../../guides/webpack#,new guide>>. For some history and context, read on.

Over the years we've implemented and shipped a variety of features to help
integration with the JavaScript ecosystem, but the end result has, in truth,
felt more like a patchwork of solutions than something cut from whole
cloth. Some of this can be attributed to trying to work around JavaScript
existing tooling rather than embracing it. ClojureScript has invested heavily in
the advanced compilation capabilities of the decade-old Google Closure Compiler
project, and it seemed natural to pursue processing Node modules through it.

But after nearly three years since we first shipped Node module processing via
Closure, it's apparent that too few of the most popular libraries can be
subjected to advanced optimizations. While we still believe there's promise
here, the ClojureScript community will have to show the rest of the world the
way by developing compelling JavaScript libraries that can be readily consumed
by popular JavaScript tools, yet still be subjected to Closure's phenomenal tree
shaking and code splitting when building with ClojureScript. In the meantime we
need a simpler and, yes, easier way to get things done.

In

Nuno Monteiro's original post] about Node module processing there's a fairly
short paragraph about how under Node.js we actually generate Node.js `require`
statements for libaries we know are coming from `node_modules`. This was a
fantastic idea resulting in a very idiomatic experience when interacting
with Node.js. Over the next couple of years it became apparent that using
ClojureScript for Node.js was often simpler than web development. No longer, the
bundle target approach embraces the fact that nearly all modern JavaScript
dependency resolution is either Node.js `require` or ES6 import.

Still, this only solves part of the problem. We need to apply advanced
optimizations to ClojureScript generated JavaScript. Which leads us to something
we call "externs inference". One of the tradeoffs with Closure's compilation model
is that integrating libraries not intended for Closure consumption requires a
manual and error-prone process of writing externs - files which prevent Closure
from renaming properties and declarations from libraries it will not actually
see. Because of an early decision by Rich Hickey to mark global variables in
ClojureScript as such, and the fact that Clojure provides a simple but effective
type propagation algorithm across a local scope which ClojureScript also
implements, tracking the usage of "foreign" values is not as tricky as it would
seem.

Combining our approach for Node.js and externs inference leads us directly to
the bundle target. Of course now it all probably seems pretty obvious - but
juggling various design goals can easily obscure the simple answer. By taking
two distinct things - on the one hand, ClojureScript, on the other, JavaScript
tools - and actually allowing them to remain distinct - we can arrive at
something more than the sum of the parts.

This feature is the result of many discussions and inspiration from some great
projects in the ClojureScript community - in particular re-natal and
shadow-cljs.

Happy hacking!
